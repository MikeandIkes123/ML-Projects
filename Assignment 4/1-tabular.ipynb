    "# Part 1: Tabular Q-Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the assignment you will familiarize yourself with the [Gymnasium API](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) for reinforcement learning and implement a tabular Q-learning agent to learn a behavioral policy in the simple [Taxi environment](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/taxi/). This is intended as a warmup on a relatively small and simple task, preparing for a more challenging deep reinforcement learning task in part 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning objectives.** You will:\n",
    "1. Install and study the standard Gymnasium API for representing a reinforcement learning environment simulation\n",
    "2. Implement the tabular Q-learning algorithm with epsilon greedy action selection\n",
    "3. Train an agent / compute an optimal q function and policy, experimenting with various hyperparameters like the learning rate and exploration decay\n",
    "4. Evaluate the learning curve of average episodic return over training"
